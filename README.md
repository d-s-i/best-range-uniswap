This application aim to help liquidity provider on uniswap to find the best range on any stable pool by analyzing range and fees generated withing the range.

You can then enter your capital to simulate like if you provided liquidity within those range and see how much you would earn daily on average (the data is an average of the last 30 days).

For now the project still is in early beta stage, working on querying valuable data and interpreting it programatically.

It is using the BigNumber library, the Tradingview widgter (hoping to change to display a graph directly with Uniswap's data) and The Graph.
